My Parrot Mambo drone died by crash, so I had extra controller with no use.  

It didn't have ready driver, so I decided to make one.  

Have fun!

## What this does
This project turns the **Parrot Flypad controller** into a fully working  
**Xbox 360 gamepad** on Windows.  
That means you can use it in games, emulators, or any software  
that expects an XInput controller.

## How it works
- The Flypad only talks over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).  
- Windows has no native driver for it.  
- This bridge listens to Flypad BLE packets â†’ maps them to ViGEm virtual gamepad.  
- The result: Windows thinks you have a normal Xbox 360 pad.

## Requirements
- Windows 10/11  
- Python 3.11+  
- [ViGEmBus driver](https://vigem.org/)  
- Packages:  
  ```bash
  pip install bleak vgamepad

## Run

Run flypad2joy_fast.py once.

If no flypad.conf is found, the script writes the embedded template to disk.

Then it exits.

Edit the generated flypad.conf if needed.

Run the script again and power on the FlyPad.
